[detectProtocol]Type of the protocol that detects a routing loop.
[detectProtocolAttr]Information about the loop detection protocol.IS-IS and OSPF are the address family and protocol process ID. BGP is an address family or sub-address family.
[redistributeID1]Redistribution device ID 1. In IS-IS, it is the system ID of the process. In OSPF, it is the router ID and instance ID of the process. In BGP, it is the BGP instance ID and a 4-byte random number.

;
�Cause 1:
If the loop detection type is IS-IS, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 and RedistributeID2 correspond to the system IDs of the IS-IS processes on the two devices where a routing loop occurs. When the IS-IS processes on the two devices import routes from other IS-IS processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
�Cause 2:
If the loop detection type is ISIS-OSPF/OSPFv3, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 corresponds to the router ID and instance ID of the OSPF/OPSFv3 process on the device that encounters a routing loop. RedistributeID2 corresponds to the system ID of the IS-IS process on the device where a routing loop occurs. When the IS-IS processes on the two devices import routes from the OSPF/OSPFv3 process, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
�Cause 3:
If the loop detection type is ISIS-BGP, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 corresponds to the VrfID and random value of the BGP process on the device that encounters a routing loop. RedistributeID2 corresponds to the system ID of the IS-IS process on the device where a routing loop occurs. When the IS-IS and BGP processes on the two devices import routes from each other, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.

When the IS-IS processes on the two devices import routes from other IS-IS processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
After IS-IS detects a loop on an imported route, it automatically increases the cost of the imported route to eliminate the impact of the loop on services.The original risk source of the routing loop caused by the re-advertisement of two devices still exists. In addition, the route cost adjusted by the system during automatic loop breaking may cause the traffic path to be inconsistent with the expected one. Therefore, after the system reports the alarm, modify the policy for importing routes in the IS-IS process on the two redistribution device as soon as possible to eliminate the configuration risk source that causes routing loops.You can run the display isis process-id lsdb verbose local | include 167772140 command to view information about the routes that have formed a loop and are automatically broken. process-id is the process ID in the alarm information about the loop detection protocol.
After the risk source that causes the loop is eliminated, run the clear route loop-detect isis alarm-state command in the system view of the device that generates the alarm to manually clear the alarm and restore the cost of the imported route to the normal value.

Fault detection
The ping service node performs link-heartbeat loopback detection to detect service faults. The packets used are ICMP detection packets. There are 12 packet templates in total. Each template sends two packets in sequence within a period of 30s. Therefore, a total of 24 packets are sent by the 12 templates within a period of 30s. After five periods, the system starts to collect statistics on lost packets and modified packets.
Link-heartbeat loopback detection is classified as packet modification detection or packet loss detection.
Packet modification detection checks whether the content of received heartbeat packets is the same as the content of sent heartbeat packets. If one of the following conditions is met, a trigger message is sent to instruct the SAID ping node to perform fault diagnosis:
1:Modified packets are detected in each of the five periods.
2:Two or more packets are modified in a period.
Fault diagnosis
After receiving the triggered message in the fault detection state, the ping service node enters the fault diagnosis state.
If a packet modification error is detected on the device, the SAID ping node checks whether a module (subcard, TM, or NP) on the device is faulty. Loopback diagnosis is performed regardless of whether a module fault occurs. If packet loss or packet modification occurs during loopback, the local device is faulty. The system then enters the fault recovery state. If no packet is lost during the loopback, the system returns to the fault detection state and generates a packet modification alarm.
Fault recovery
If a fault is detected during loopback diagnosis, the ping service node determines whether a counting error occurs on the associated subcard.
1:If a counting error occurs on the subcard, the ping service node resets the subcard for service recovery. Then, the node enters the service recovery determination state and performs link-heartbeat loopback detection to determine whether services recover. If services recover, the node returns to the fault detection state. If services do not recover, the node returns to the fault recovery state and takes a secondary recovery action. (For a subcard reset, the secondary recovery action is board reset.)
2:If no counting error occurs on the subcard, the ping service node resets the involved board for service recovery. After the board starts, the node enters the service recovery determination state and performs link-heartbeat loopback detection to determine whether services recover. If services recover, the node returns to the fault detection state. If services do not recover, the node remains in the service recovery determination state and periodically performs link-heartbeat loopback detection until services recover.
Service recovery determination
After fault recovery is complete, the ping service node uses the fault packet template to send diagnostic packets. If a fault still exists and a subcard reset is performed, the node generates an alarm and instructs the subcard to perform a switching for self-healing. If a fault still exists but no subcard reset is performed, the node generates an alarm only. If no fault exists, the node instructs the link-heartbeat loopback function to return to the initiate state, and the node itself returns to the fault detection state.
Fault alarm
If link-heartbeat loopback detects packet modification, it triggers SAID ping diagnosis and reports an alarm when any of the following conditions is met:
1:If services fail to be restored after recovery operations (reset the subcard or board), the device detects packet loss and reports an alarm.
2:If a software error occurs, the device forcibly cancels link-heartbeat loopback and reports an alarm if no other recovery operation is performed within 8 minutes.
3:If no packet loss or packet modification error occurs during link-heartbeat loopback, the device cancels the recovery operation. If no other recovery operation is performed within 8 minutes, the device reports an alarm.
4:If the board does not support SAID ping, the device reports an alarm.
;
1. Run the display link-heartbeat command to check link-heartbeat packet modification information on the corresponding interface. Check whether the link-heartbeat function detects packet modification within five consecutive detection periods (150s).
�If no packet modification is detected within five consecutive detection periods (150s), the alarm is cleared. Go to step 3.
�If packet modification is detected within five consecutive detection periods (150s), the alarm persists. Go to step 2.

(PrefixCount=[PrefixCount], MaxValue=[MaxValue], ThresholdLowerLimit=[ThresholdLowerLimit], ThresholdUpperLimit=[ThresholdUpperLimit]);The number of IPv4 route prefixes exceeded the alarm threshold.;[PrefixCount]Indicates the number of IPv4 route prefixes in the routing table.
[MaxValue]Indicates the maximum number of IPv4 route prefixes supported by the device.
[ThresholdLowerLimit]Indicates the lower threshold of IPv4 route prefixes.
[ThresholdUpperLimit]Indicates the upper threshold of IPv4 route prefixes.
;
The number of IPv4 prefixes exceeded the threshold of the routing table.
;
1. Run the display current-configuration command to check whether the threshold value specified in the ip prefix-limit system threshold-alarm command is too small. - If the threshold value is too small, go to step 2. - If the threshold value is in a proper range, go to step 3. 2. Rerun the ip prefix-limit system threshold-alarm upper-limit <upper-limit-value> lower-limit <lower-limit-value> command to increase the value of <upper-limit-value>. 3. Run the display ip routing-table statistics and display ip routing-table all-vpn-instance statistics commands to check the numbers of IPv4 public and private route prefixes and the number of routes of each protocol that are added to the routing table. Check whether services need these routes or whether the routes are added to the routing table due to incorrect configurations. - If the routes are added to the routing table due to incorrect configurations, go to step 4. - If services need these routes, go to step 5. 4. Adjust the configurations to delete unneeded routes and ensure that the number of IPv4 route prefixes falls below the <lower-limit-value> configured using the ip prefix-limit system threshold-alarm command, then check whether the RM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.145.10.4 hwIpv4PrefixThresholdExceedClear alarm is generated. - If the RM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.145.10.4 hwIpv4PrefixThresholdExceedClear alarm is not generated, go to step 5. - If theRM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.145.10.4 hwIpv4PrefixThresholdExceedClear alarm is generated, go to step 6. 5. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel. 6. End.

;
The primary LSP was Down and the backup LSP was in Up state. The backup mode was best-effort backup.Traffic switched from the primary CR-LSP to the best-effort path.
;
1. Run the display mpls te tunnel-interface <tunnel-name> command on the ingress (that is, the node that generates the trap) to check the configurations of the tunnel. View the Tunnel State Desc field to check whether the tunnel is in the Down state. Then, run the display mpls te tunnel-interface last-error command to view the prompt.
�In the case of the following error prompts, do as required:
�If the error prompt is Cspf failed to calculate a path for Tunnel. (indicating that the ingress is enabled with CSPF, but the CSPF path calculation fails), go to Step 2.
�If the error prompt is Trigger Rsvp failed, go to Step 2.
�If the error prompt is One LSP is deleted at smooth period, go to Step 6.
�If the error prompt is One LSP is deleted at Tunnel aging period, go to Step 6.
�For other types of errors, go to Step 6.
�If there is no error prompt, go to Step 2.
2. Run the ping command on the ingress to check whether the destination IP address of the tunnel can be pinged.
�If the ping fails, rectify the route fault to ensure that the destination IP address of the tunnel can be pinged, and then check whether the alarm MPLS_LSPM/4/BBRESUME is generated.
�If so, go to Step 7.
�If not, go to Step 3.
�If the ping is successful, go to Step 3.
3. Run the display this command in the MPLS view of the ingress to check whether the mpls te cspf command is configured, that is, to check whether the CSPF is enabled.
�If so, go to Step 4.
�If not, go to Step 5.
4. Run the display mpls te cspf destination command on the ingress to check whether a path that meets the constraints is available. If so, the path of the TE tunnel is displayed, indicating that CSPF calculation is successful. If not, null is displayed, indicating that CSPF calculation fails.
�If the path is successfully calculated, run the display current-configuration interface <interface-type> <interface-number> command on the ingress to check the tunnel configurations, including the primary tunnel, protection tunnel, and the protection interface. Check whether the mpls te auto-frr command is configured in the MPLS view. If so, it indicates that Auto FRR is enabled. In this case, you can check the primary tunnel. If not, check whether the mpls te fast-reroute, mpls te record-route, and mpls te bypass-tunnel are configured to identify the primary and backup tunnels.
�After the primary and backup tunnels are checked, you can check the explicit-path command to verify whether the explicit path is configured; check the mpls te affinity property command to verify whether the affinity property is configured; check the mpls te bandwidth command to verify whether the bandwidth is configured.
1. If the explicit path fails to be calculated, check whether the interfaces along the explicit path are in the Up state and are enabled with MPLS and MPLS TE. If the explicit path is successfully calculated, check whether path calculation according to the affinity property and bandwidth is consistent with the explicit path by running the display mpls te cspf destination <ip-address> bandwidth ct0 <ct0-bandwidth> explicit-path <path-name> command.
2. If CSPF path calculation fails after affinity property is configured, run the mpls te affinity property command in the tunnel view to modify the affinity property of the tunnel, or run the mpls te link administrative group on the interfaces along the tunnel to modify the administrative group property of the link.
3. If CSPF path calculation fails after bandwidth is configured, run the display mpls te link-administration bandwidth-allocation interface <interface-type> <interface-number> command to check whether the bandwidth of each outbound interface along the tunnel is enough. If the bandwidth is enough, it is possible that the tunnel with a higher priority preempts the bandwidth of the current tunnel. Then run the mpls te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth and mpls te bandwidth commands in the interface view to increase the bandwidth.
4. If CSPF path calculation fails because of other constraints, go to Step 6.
�Then, check whether the alarm MPLS_LSPM/4/BBRESUME is generated.
�If so, go to Stpe 7.
�If not, go to Step 5.
�If CSPF path calculation fails, go to Step 5.
5. Run the display explicit-path command to check the interfaces along the tunnel. Then, run the display this command in the interface view of each interface of the tunnel to check whether the interface is enabled with MPLS, MPLS TE, and RSVP-TE.
�If MPLS, MPLS TE, or RSVP-TE is not enabled, run the mpls, mpls te or mpls rsvp-te commands in the view of the interface.
�If any interface along the tunnel is not in Up state, restart the interface. That is, run the shutdown and then undo shutdown commands in the interface view.
�If so, go to Step 7.
�If not, go to Step 6.
6. Collect the trap information, log information, and configuration of the router, and then contact technical support personnel.

�Cspf failed to calculate a path for Tunnel: CSPF is enabled on the ingress but CSPF fails to calculate a path for the tunnel. Check whether configurations for explicit paths are correct, whether IS-IS TE or OSPF TE has been enabled, and whether routing configurations are correct.
�If the configuration is corrected, the alarm is cleared.
�If the alarm persists, go to Step 3.

�If the configuration is corrected, the alarm is cleared.
�If the alarm persists, go to Step 3.
�Routing Problem:No route available toward destination.: CSPF is not enabled on either the ingress or any transit node, or an incorrect explicit path or an unreachable route to the destination address is configured. Correctly reconfigure the explicit path or an IGP.
�If the configuration is corrected, the alarm is cleared.
�If the alarm persists, go to Step 3.
�Service preempted: Tunnel resources are preempted. Reconfigure the setup and holding priorities on the tunnel interface.
�If the configuration is corrected, the alarm is cleared.
�If the alarm persists, go to Step 3.
�Admission Control failure: The ingress is enabled with CSPF but its downstream nodes is not. Along an explicit path, CSPF counts the bandwidth: the bandwidth of the ingress is sufficient; but the link bandwidth of downstream nodes is insufficient. Check the explicit path and bandwidth configurations.
�If the configuration is corrected, the alarm is cleared.
�If the alarm persists, go to Step 3.
�If other errors occurs, go to Step 4.
�If no error information is displayed, go to Step 3.
3. Run the display mpls lsp statistics command to check whether the number of LSPs exceeds the upper limit. If the number of LSPs exceeds the upper limit, delete unwanted LSPs and check whether the alarm is cleared. If the alarm persists, go to Step 4.

;
Improper configurations exist on some devices on the network. For example, the number of times for allowable local AS number repetition is set (using the peer allow-as-loop command) and the route preference is changed in a routing policy; alternatively, the AS number and route preference are changed in a routing policy. As a result, a device receives the routes that it has advertised from its BGP peers again, and the preference of the received routes is higher than that of the routes advertised by the device.
;
After detecting a BGP route loop, the device automatically adjusts the route selection rule to eliminate the impact of route flapping caused by the loop on services.
Loops still exist between devices. In addition, the route selection rules adjusted by the system during automatic loop breaking may cause the traffic path to be different from the expected one. After the system reports an alarm, you can check the routing information about the loop based on the diagnosis log and rectify the improper configuration that causes the loop. In this way, the risk source of the loop is eliminated.
After the risk source is eliminated, run the clear route loop-detect bgp alarm command in the system view of the device generating the alarm to manually clear the alarm.

�Cause 1: The interface went Down.
1. Run the display mpls te tunnel-interface <tunnel-name> command on the ingress (the node where the alarm is generated) to check the tunnel configuration. Check the Tunnel State Desc field to determine whether the tunnel is down. Run the display mpls te tunnel-interface last-error command to check the error message.
�If the following error information is displayed:

�If yes, go to Step 4.
�If no, go to Step 5.
4. Run the display mpls te cspf destination command on the ingress to check whether a path satisfying the specified constraints exists. If such a path is available, the path information is displayed and CSPF path calculation succeeds. If such a path is unavailable, no path information is displayed and CSPF path calculation fails.
�If the path computation is successful, run the display current-configuration interface <interface-type> <interface-number> command on the ingress to check tunnel configurations. Determine the working tunnel, protection tunnel, and protection interface. Check whether the mpls te auto-frr command is run in the MPLS view. If the command is run, automatic protection is configured. In this case, you can determine which tunnel is the primary tunnel according to the configuration of the tunnel. If the mpls te auto-frr command is not run, check the mpls te fast-reroute, mpls te record-route, and mpls te bypass-tunnel command configurations to determine the primary and backup tunnels.
After determining the primary and backup tunnels, perform the following checks: Check whether the explicit-path command is run to determine whether an explicit path is configured for the tunnel. Check whether the mpls te affinity property command is run to determine whether the affinity attribute is configured for the tunnel. Check whether the mpls te bandwidth command is run to determine whether the bandwidth is configured for the tunnel.
Run the display mpls te cspf destination command with constraints specified based on tunnel configurations. The parameters include priority setup-priority, bandwidth, explicit-path path-name, affinity, and hop-limit hop-limit-number. Then check whether a path that satisfies the constraints exists. If such a path is available, the path information is displayed and CSPF path calculation succeeds. If such a path is unavailable, no path information is displayed and CSPF path calculation fails.
�a. If explicit path calculation fails, check the explicit path and tunnel interface configurations to determine the primary and backup paths. Check whether each interface along the explicit path is up and whether MPLS and MPLS TE are enabled. If explicit path calculation succeeds, check whether the affinity attribute and bandwidth are successfully calculated and whether they are the same as those of the explicit path. You can run the display mpls te cspf destination <ip-address> bandwidth ct0 <ct0-bandwidth> explicit-path <path-name> command.
�b. If affinities fail to be used to compute a path, run the mpls te affinity property command in the tunnel interface view to modify affinities and run the mpls te link administrative group command in the view of each interface along the path to modify the administrative group attribute.
�c. If bandwidth-based path computation fails, run the display mpls te link-administration bandwidth-allocation interface <interface-type> <interface-number> command to check whether the bandwidth of the outbound interfaces along the tunnel is sufficient. If bandwidth resources are sufficient, a higher-priority tunnel may preempt bandwidth resources of an existing tunnel. Run the mpls te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth and mpls te bandwidth command to increase bandwidth values.
�d. If path calculation based on other constraints fails, go to Step 6.
Then, check whether the MPLS_LSPM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.121.2.1.48 hwMplsTunnelHotstandbyUp alarm is generated.
�If yes, go to Step 7.
�If no, go to Step 5.

[SuppressState]Interface suppression status: 0: The interface is not suppressed. 1: The interface is suppressed.
;
The interface had the flapping control function configured. When the interface alternated between Up and Down frequently, the interface became suppressed. The number of the interface flapping times that triggers the suppression alarm depends on the control-flap command configuration.
;
1. Check the physical link. Interface flapping usually results from a physical link fault or link instability during a short time.If the physical link works improperly, you need to check whether the hardware such as the network cable or optical module is disconnected or loosely connected and correctly connect the physical link and then check whether the alarm is cleared. If the alarm is not cleared, go to Step 2.
�If the alarm is generated on a physical interface, check whether the physical link of the interface works properly.
�If the alarm is generated on a sub-interface, check whether the physical link of the main interface works properly.
�If the alarm is generated on a trunk interface, check whether the physical links of the trunk member interfaces work properly.
2. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.

;
Cause 1: The input optical power of the optical interface is excessively high or low.
1. Check whether the optical power of the optical interface is abnormal.
Cause 2: The optical fiber is bent excessively.
1. Check the fiber jumper. If the fiber jumper is bent too much, damaged, or aged, adjust or replace the fiber jumper.
Cause 3: The fiber connectors at both ends are dirty.
1. Check the fiber connector. If the fiber connector is dirty, clean or replace the fiber. For details, see Checking and Cleaning Fiber Connectors.
Cause 4: The optical module is not securely inserted or is faulty.
1. If the optical module is pluggable, check whether it is securely installed. If yes, reinstall the optical module. If the alarm persists, replace the optical module.
Cause 5: The FEC modes of the two interconnected boards are different.
1. Check whether the FEC modes of the two interconnected boards are the same. If not, change the FEC modes to ensure that they are the same.
Cause 6: The board or optical module that reports the alarm is faulty.
1. Use an optical fiber to perform a self-loop on the optical port. If the alarm is cleared, the optical module and the board are normal.
Cause 7: The peer board or optical module is faulty.
1. Use an optical fiber to perform a self-loop on the optical port. If the alarm is cleared, the optical module and the board are normal.
Cause 8: The loss and reflection of the intermediate connector of the optical cable are large.
1. Disconnect the peer optical fiber and use the OTDR to test the loss and reflection of each link and node at the local end. Check whether the loss and reflection of each link and node are normal (splicing connector loss < 0.3 dB/node, connector loss < 0.75 dB/node, and connector reflection < &#xfffd;&#xfffd;30 dB/node). If the loss and reflection exceed the requirements, in this case, handle the abnormal port.
2. Based on the distance of the abnormal point in the OTDR test result, locate the equipment room where the port is located and preliminarily determine the port location. Disconnect the port and perform the OTDR test on the port that reports the alarm to check whether the distance is consistent with the previous test. If not, continue to test other ports.
3. After locating the abnormal port, use a fiberscope to check the port. If the port is contaminated, clean it. For details, see Checking and Cleaning Fiber Connectors.
4. After the ports are cleaned, restore the ports and tighten the connectors. Perform an OTDR test on the ports that report alarms to check whether the loss and reflection of each link and node are normal.
5. If the fault persists, replace the flange plate and perform an OTDR test on the port that reports the alarm to check whether the loss and reflection of each link and node are normal.
6. If the fault persists, replace the fiber and perform an OTDR test on the port that reports the alarm to check whether the loss and reflection of each link and node are normal.
7. If there are multiple abnormal points on the link, repeat steps 2 to 6.

1. Run the display current-configuration command to check whether the source IP address configured on the PCE server is consistent with the IP address of the candidate server configured on the PCE client. - If yes, go to step 2. - If no, run the source-address command on the PCE server or the connect-server command on the forwarder to modify the configuration, so that the source IP address configured on the PCE server is consistent with the IP address of the candidate server configured on the PCC client. Then, check whether the fault is resolved. If the fault persists, proceed with the subsequent operations. 2. Run the display current-configuration command to check whether the keychain configuration on the PCE server is consistent with that on the PCE client, such as the authentication algorithm and Key-id. If the configuration is consistent, it is recommended that the key-string command be run to set a password to ensure that the keychain configuration is consistent at both ends. Then, check whether the fault is resolved. If the fault persists, proceed with the subsequent operations. 3. Run the display ip routing-table command on the forwarder to check whether the forwarder has received the routing from the server. - If yes, go to step 4. - If no, check whether the IS-IS configuration is consistent at both ends. Such configuration include the system ID, IS-IS level, and regional address. If the IS-IS configuration is inconsistent, modify the configuration by referring to section IS-IS Configuration, ensuring that the forwarder can receive the routing from the server. Then, check whether the fault is resolved. If the fault persists, go to step 4. 4. Check whether the physical connection between the PCE server and PCE client is normal. - If yes, go to step 5. - If no, disconnect and then reconnect the forwarder and controller, or replace the physical connection between the forwarder and controller for the link to be normal. Then, check whether the fault is resolved. If the fault persists, go to step 5. 5. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.

�If the ping succeeds, go to Step 2.
2. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.
�Cause 2: Physical interface change
1. Run the display ospf interface command to check the status of the physical interface used to set up the OSPF neighbor relationship.
�If the physical interface is in the Down state, check whether the optical power of the physical interface is within the permitted range and whether the transport device works properly. Restore the physical interface status to clear the alarm.
�If the physical interface is in the *down state, the interface has been shut down. Then run the undo shutdown command on the interface to clear the alarm.
�If the physical interface is in the Up state, go to Step 2.
2. Run the display ospf interface command to check the protocol status of the interface used to set up the OSPF neighbor relationship.
�If the protocol state is Down, check whether the interface IP addresses are configured correctly. If no, configure the IP addresses correctly to clear the alarm.
�If the protocol state is Up, go to Step 3.
3. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.
�Cause 3: Protocol reason
1. Run the display this command in both the interface view and OSPF view of the local and remote devices to check whether the two devices use the same protocol.
�If the two devices use the same protocol, go to Step 2.
�If the two devices use different protocols, configure the same protocol for the interfaces.
2. Run the display ospf peer command to view OSPF neighbor information.
�If no OSPF neighbor information is displayed, the local device cannot receive any Hello messages from the remote device or the received Hello messages have been discarded. Then go to Step 3.
�If Init is displayed, the local device can receive Hello messages from the remote device, whereas the remote device cannot receive any Hello messages from the local device. Run the ping command to check whether the link that connects the local and remote devices functions properly. A common cause for the OSPF neighbor to stay in the Init state is that a fault occurs in packet forwarding and hence packets are discarded. If the alarm persists after the fault in packet forwarding is rectified, go to Step
�If 2-way is displayed, the value of ospf dr-priority is 0. Run the ospf dr-priority command to set the DR priority of the interface to a value larger than 0 to clear the alarm.
�If Exstart is displayed, the device generating this alarm keeps performing DD negotiation but fails to complete DD synchronization. Then go to Step 3.
�If Loading is displayed, the local device has received invalid LSA packets and keeps sending LSA requests. Run the reset
ospf process command at both ends of the link to clear the alarm.
The OSPF neighbor relationship may be deleted after you run the reset ospf process command to reset the OSPF connection. Run this command only when it is very necessary.
3. Run the display this command in the interface view and OSPF view to check whether authentication modes configured for both ends are the same.
�If the authentication modes configured for both ends are the same, go to Step 4.
�If the authentication modes configured for both ends are different, change them to be the same.
4. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.
�Cause 4: BFD session state change
1. Run the ping command to check whether the link that connects the local and remote devices functions properly.
�If the ping fails, check the transport devices, link status, and interface status and rectify faults (if any) on the physical devices to restore OSPF services.
�If the ping succeeds, go to Step 4.
2. Run the ping command in the interface view to check whether the link is configured correctly.
�If the link is correctly configured, go to Step 3.
�If the link is incorrectly configured, correct link configurations.
3. Run the display ospf peer command to check whether the OSPF neighbor is in the Up state.
�If the OSPF neighbor is in the Up state, go to Step 4.
�If the OSPF neighbor is in the Down state, correct link configurations.
4. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.
�Cause 5: Configuration change
1. Run the display this command in the OSPF view to check whether area configurations at both ends of the neighbor are consistent.
�If area configurations at both ends are inconsistent, change them to be the same.
�If area configurations at both ends are consistent, go to Step 2.
2. Run the display this command in the OSPF view to check whether opaque-capability has been enabled for the OSPF processes at both ends.
�If opaque-capability has been enabled only for one OSPF process, enable opaque-capability for the OSPF process at the other end.
�If opaque-capability has been enabled for the OSPF processes at both ends, go to Step 3.
3. Run the display ospf interface command to check whether OSPF network types configured on the interfaces at both ends are consistent.
�If OSPF network types configured on the interfaces at both ends are inconsistent, change them to be the same.
�If OSPF network types configured on the interfaces at both ends are consistent, go to Step 4.
4. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.
�Cause 6: Peer router reason
1. Check whether the peer router is a non-Huawei device.
�If it is a non-Huawei device, go to Step 2.
�If it is a Huawei device, go to Step 3.
2. Contact the non-Huawei device manufacturer to check its operating status and rectify the fault.
3. Check whether the peer router or the OSPF process has been restarted.
�If the peer router or the OSPF process has been restarted, refer to alarm and log information to identify the cause.
�If the peer router or the OSPF process has not been restarted, go to Step 4.
4. Collect alarm information and configuration information, and then contact technical support personnel.

�Cause 1: Adjacency holdTimer expired
�Cause 2: Physical interface change
�Cause 3: Protocol reason
�Cause 4: BFD session state change
�Cause 5: Configuration change
�Cause 7: Peer router reason
;
�Cause 1: Adjacency holdTimer expired
1. Run the display ipv6 interface and display ospfv3 peer commands to check the Up/Down status of the interface connected to the neighbor.
�If the physical interface is Down, check the link and ensure that the link is Up, and then go to Step 2.
If the physical interface is Up, go to Step 2.
2. Check whether packets are correctly forwarded and ping the IP address of the peer interface.
If the ping operation fails, go to step 5.
If the ping operation succeeds, go to Step 3.
3. Run the display ipv6 interface command on the neighbor to check whether the interface of the OSPFv3 neighbor is Up.
If the interface is Down, go to Step 5.
If the interface is Up, go to Step 4.
4. Run the display ospfv3 interface command to check whether the configurations on both ends are correct.
If the configurations are correct, go to step 6.
If the configuration is incorrect, go to Step 5.
5. Collect alarm and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.
6. End.
�Cause 2: Physical interface change
1. Run the display ipv6 interface command to check whether the physical status of the interface on which the OSPFv3 neighbor relationship is established is normal.
�If the physical status of the interface is Down, check the optical power of the interface and whether the transmission device is normal. Restore the physical status of the interface to clear the alarm.
�If the physical status of the interface is *down, the interface has been shut down manually. Run the undo shutdown command on the interface to clear the alarm.
�If the physical status of the interface is Up, go to Step 2.
2. Run the display ipv6 interface command to check the protocol status of the interface that establishes the OSPFv3 neighbor relationship.
�If the current protocol status is Down, check whether an IPv6 address is configured and whether the IPv6 address is correct. If yes, clear the alarm by checking the IPv6 address.
�If the protocol status is Up, go to Step 3.
3. Collect alarm and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.
4. End.
�Cause 3: Protocol reason
1. Run the display this command in the interface view and OSPFv3 view of the local and remote devices to check whether the same protocol is enabled on the devices at both ends of the link.
�If so, go to Step 2.
�If not, configure the same protocol on the interfaces at both ends of the link where the neighbor relationship needs to be established.
2. Run the display ospfv3 peer command to check OSPF neighbor information.
�If no neighbor information is displayed, the local device cannot receive Hello packets from the peer device or the received Hello packets are discarded. Go to step 3.
�If Init is displayed, the local device can receive Hello packets from the peer device, but the peer device cannot receive Hello packets from the local device. Run the ping command to check whether the link to the peer device is normal. Generally, this problem occurs because the forwarding plane is faulty. As a result, packets are discarded. If the alarm cannot be cleared by rectifying the forwarding fault, go to step 4.
�If 2-way is displayed, ospfv3 dr-priority 0 has been configured on the OSPFv3 interface. Run the ospfv3 dr-priority command to set the DR priority of the interface to a value greater than 0 to clear the alarm.
�If Exstart is displayed, the device keeps performing DD negotiation and cannot complete DD synchronization. Go to step 3.
�If Loading is displayed, the local device considers the received LSAs invalid, discards them, and keeps requesting for LSAs. You can run the reset ospfv3 process-id command on both ends of the link where the OSPFv3 neighbor relationship needs to be established to clear the alarm.
Resetting an OSPFv3 connection (using the reset ospfv3 process-id command) interrupts the OSPFv3 neighbor relationship between devices. Exercise caution when resetting OSPFv3 connections.
3. Run the display this command in the interface view and OSPFv3 process view to check whether the authentication configurations on both ends of the link are the same.
�If so, go to Step 4.
�If not, configure the same authentication mode on both ends of the link.
4. Collect alarm and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.
5. End.
�Cause 4: BFD session state change
1. Run the ping command to check whether the link to the peer device is normal.
�If the peer device cannot be pinged, check the transmission devices, links, and interfaces, and adjust the hardware to restore services.
�If the ping operation succeeds, go to step 4.
2. Run the ping command in the interface view to check whether the link configuration is correct.
�If the configurations are correct, go to Step 3.
�If the configuration is incorrect, modify the configuration.
3. Run the display ospfv3 peer command to check whether the neighbor relationship is Up.
�If the neighbor relationship is Up, go to Step 4.
�If the neighbor relationship is Down, rectify the fault.
4. Collect alarm and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.
5. End.
�Cause 5: Configuration change
1. Run the display this command in the OSPFv3 process view to check whether the area configurations on both ends of the neighbor are consistent.
�If they are different, change them to be the same.
�If they are consistent, go to Step 2.
2. Run the display ospfv3 interface command to check whether the ospfv3 network-type values of the interfaces at both ends of the link are the same.
�If they are different, change them to be the same.
�If they are consistent, go to Step 3.
3. Collect alarm and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.
4. End.
�Cause 7: Peer router reason
1. Check whether the peer device is provided by another vendor.
�If yes, go to Step 2.
�If no, go to Step 3.
2. Contact the vendor to check the running status of the peer device.
3. Check whether the peer device or OSPFv3 process is restarted.
�If the peer device or OSPFv3 process has been restarted, locate the fault based on the alarm and log information on the peer device.
�If the peer device or OSPFv3 process is not restarted, go to Step 4.
4. Collect alarm and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.
5. End.

1. Run the display mpls interface command. If the trap is generated on the ingress of static CR-LSPs, you need to check the information about only the outbound interface; if the trap is generated on the egress of static CR-LSPs, you need to check the information about only the inbound interface; if the trap is generated on the transit of static LSPs, you need to check the information about the outbound interface and inbound interface. You need to check whether the corresponding interface is displayed in the command output, whether the Status field of the interface is Up, and whether the TE Attr field is En.
�If the interface status is not Up, check the interface.
�If the MPLS or MPLS TE is not enabled, configure this function.

�If the tunnel is not consistent with the destination address of the static CR-LSP, you need to enter the corresponding tunnel view and run the destination command to modify the destination address of the tunnel.
�If the signaling mode is not cr-static, run the mpls te signal-protocol cr-static command to modify the signaling mode of the tunnel.
�After modifying the configuration of the tunnel, run the commit command to commit the modification.
�If neither preceding operations can locate the fault, go to Step 3.
3. If the static CR-LSP is configured with the bandwidth attribute, run the display current-configuration interface interface-number command to check the maximal bandwidth and the maximal reservable bandwidth on the outbound interface.
�If neither preceding operations can locate the fault, go to Step 4.
�If the available bandwidth of the outgoing interface is smaller than the bandwidth required by the static CR-LSP, you need to enter the corresponding interface view and run the mpls te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth command to increase the bandwidth of the outgoing interface.
�After modifying the configuration of the tunnel, run the commit command to commit the modification.
Then check whether the trap is cleared.
�If the trap is cleared, go to Step 5.
�If the trap is not cleared, go to Step 4.

4. Run the display mpls te cspf destination command on the ingress to check whether a path that meets the constraints is available. If so, the path of the TE tunnel is displayed, indicating that CSPF calculation is successful. If not, null is displayed, indicating that CSPF calculation fails.
�If the path is successfully calculated, run the display current-configuration interface <interface-type> <interface-number> command on the ingress to check the tunnel configurations, including the primary tunnel, protection tunnel, and the protection interface. Check whether the mpls te auto-frr command is configured in the MPLS view. If so, it indicates that Auto FRR is enabled. In this case, you can check the primary tunnel. If not, check whether the mpls te fast-reroute, mpls te record-route, and mpls te bypass-tunnel are configured to identify the primary and backup tunnels.
After the primary and backup tunnels are checked, you can check the explicit-path command to verify whether the explicit path is configured; check the mpls te affinity property command to verify whether the affinity property is configured; check the mpls te bandwidth command to verify whether the bandwidth is configured.
Run the display mpls te cspf destination command and configure the parameters of constraints one by one, including the priority (priority setup-priority), bandwidth (bandwidth), explicit path (explicit-path path-name), affinity property (affinity properties), and hop limit (hop-limit hop-limit-number), and you can check whether the path that meets the constraints is available. If so, the path of the TE tunnel is displayed, indicating that CSPF calculation is successful. If not, null is displayed, indicating that CSPF calculation fails.
�a. If the explicit path fails to be calculated, check whether the interfaces along the explicit path are in the Up state and are enabled with MPLS and MPLS TE. If the explicit path is successfully calculated, check whether path calculation according to the affinity property and bandwidth is consistent with the explicit path by running the display mpls te cspf destination <ip-address> bandwidth ct0 <ct0-bandwidth> explicit-path <path-name> command.
�b. If CSPF path calculation fails after affinity property is configured, run the mpls te affinity property command in the tunnel view to modify the affinity property of the tunnel, or run the mpls te link administrative group on the interfaces along the tunnel to modify the administrative group property of the link.
�c. If CSPF path calculation fails after bandwidth is configured, run the display mpls te link-administration bandwidth-allocation interface <interface-type> <interface-number> command to check whether the bandwidth of each outbound interface along the tunnel is enough. If the bandwidth is enough, it is possible that the tunnel with a higher priority preempts the bandwidth of the current tunnel. Then run the mpls te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth and mpls te bandwidth commands in the interface view to increase the bandwidth.

[DetectProtocolAttr]Information about the loop detection protocol.
[RedistributeID1]Re-advertisement device ID 1.
[RedistributeID2]Re-advertisement device ID 2.
;
�Cause 1:
If the loop detection type is OSPF, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 and RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPF processes on the two devices where a routing loop occurs. When the OSPF processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPF processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
�Cause 2:
If the loop detection type is OSPF-ISIS, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 correspond to the System ID of the ISIS processes on the devices where a routing loop occurs, RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPF processes on the devices where a routing loop occurs. When the ISIS/OSPF processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPF/ISIS processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
�Cause 3:
If the loop detection type is OSPF-BGP, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
When the BGP/OSPF processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPF/BGP processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs. RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPF processes on the devices where a routing loop occurs.
;
�Cause 1:
If the loop detection type is OSPF, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 and RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPF processes on the two devices where a routing loop occurs. When the OSPF processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPF processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
After detecting a loop on an imported route, OSPF automatically increases the cost of the imported route to eliminate the loop. In this manner, the impact of the loop on services is automatically eliminated. The original risk source of the routing loop caused by the two re-advertisement devices still exists. In addition, the route cost adjusted by the system during automatic loop prevention may cause the traffic path to be different from the planned path. Therefore, after the system reports the alarm, modify the policy for importing routes in the OSPF processes on the two re-advertisement devices as soon as possible to eliminate the risk source that causes routing loops. You can run the display ospf process-id import-route loop-detect state command to view information about the routes that have encountered loops and are automatically removed. process-id specifies the process ID in the alarm parameter loop detection protocol information.
After eliminating the risk source that causes the loop, run the clear route loop-detect ospf alarm-state command in the system view of the device that generates the alarm to clear the alarm and restore the cost of the imported route to the normal value.
�Cause 2:

In addition, the route cost adjusted by the system during automatic loop prevention may cause the traffic path to be different from the planned path. Therefore, after the system reports the alarm, modify the route import policy configuration in the IS-IS and OSPF processes on the two re-advertisement devices as soon as possible to eliminate the risk source that causes routing loops. You can run the display ospf process-id import-route loop-detect state command to view information about the routes that have encountered loops and are automatically removed. process-id specifies the process ID in the alarm parameter loop detection protocol information.

;
Cause 1: Traffic packets were illegitimate. For example, the maximum length of packets that can be received by an interface is 9600 bytes, but the length of packets received from the peer end is greater than 9600 bytes. In this case, the interface reports LongPacket statistics logs.
Cause 2: The CRC encapsulation of traffic packets was inconsistent with that on the device. For example, the packets received by the device do not carry the CRC byte, but the device removes the CRC byte by default. In addition, the packet length is greater than the maximum packet length that is allowed by the interface. As a result, the interface reports Jabber statistics logs.
;
1. Run the display this interface command in the interface view to check whether the packet statistics displayed in the log on the interface are not 0.
�If so, go to Step 2.
�If not, go to Step 3.
2. Check whether the physical link is normal and collect the check result.
�If the interface is an electrical interface, check whether the network cable is normal.

[RedistributeID1]Re-advertise device ID 1.

;
�Cause 1:
If the loop detection type is OSPFv3, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 and RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPFv3 processes on the two devices where a routing loop occurs. When the OSPFv3 processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPFv3 processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
�Cause 2:
If the loop detection type is OSPFv3-ISIS, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 correspond to the System ID of the ISIS processes on the devices where a routing loop occurs, RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPFv3 processes on the devices where a routing loop occurs. When the ISIS/OSPFv3 processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPFv3/ISIS processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
�Cause 3:
If the loop detection type is OSPFv3-BGP, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
When the BGP/OSPFv3 processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPFv3/BGP processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs. RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPFv3 processes on the devices where a routing loop occurs.

�Cause 1:
If the loop detection type is OSPFv3, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
RedistributeID1 and RedistributeID2 correspond to the router ID and process ID of the OSPFv3 processes on the two devices where a routing loop occurs. When the OSPFv3 processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPFv3 processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured. As a result, a routing loop occurs.
After detecting a loop on an imported route, OSPFv3 automatically increases the cost of the imported route to attempt to eliminate the loop. In this manner, the impact of the loop on services is automatically eliminated. The original risk source of the routing loop caused by the two re-advertisement devices still exists. In addition, the route cost adjusted by the system during automatic loop prevention may cause the traffic path to be different from the planned path. Therefore, after the system reports the alarm, modify the policy for importing routes in the OSPFv3 processes on the two re-advertisement devices as soon as possible to eliminate the risk source that causes routing loops. You can run the display ospfv3 process-id import-route loop-detect state command to view information about the routes that have encountered loops and are automatically removed. process-id specifies the process ID in the alarm parameter loop detection protocol information.
�Cause 2:
If the loop detection type is OSPFv3-ISIS, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:

In addition, the route cost adjusted by the system during automatic loop prevention may cause the traffic path to be different from the planned path. Therefore, after the system reports the alarm, modify the route import policy configuration in the IS-IS and OSPFv3 processes on the two re-advertisement devices as soon as possible to eliminate the risk source that causes routing loops. You can run the display ospfv3 process-id import-route loop-detect state command to view information about the routes that have encountered loops and are automatically removed. process-id specifies the process ID in the alarm parameter loop detection protocol information.
After eliminating the risk source that causes the loop, run the clear route loop-detect ospfv3 alarm-state command in the system view of the device that generates the alarm to clear the alarm and restore the cost of the imported route to the normal value.
�Cause 3:
If the loop detection type is OSPFv3-BGP, the possible causes of the alarm are as follows:
When the BGP/OSPFv3 processes on the two devices import routes from other OSPFv3/BGP processes, no import policy is configured or the import policy is incorrectly configured.

Fault detection
Link heartbeat detection is used to detect service faults. Link heartbeats refer to ICMP detection packets. There are 12 packet templates in total. Each template sends two packets in sequence within a period of 30s. Therefore, a total of 24 packets are sent by the 12 templates within a period of 30s. After five periods, the system starts to collect statistics on lost packets and modified packets.
Link-heartbeat loopback detection is classified as packet modification detection or packet loss detection.
Packet loss detection checks whether the difference between the number of received heartbeat packets and the number of sent heartbeat packets is within the permitted range. If one of the following conditions is met, a trigger message is sent to instruct the SAID ping node to perform fault diagnosis:
1:The total number of lost packets exceeds 3.
2:After each packet sending period ends, the system checks the protocol status and whether ARP entries exist on the interface and find that there is no ARP in three consecutive periods.
3:The absolute value of the difference between the number of lost packets whose payload is all 0s and the number of lost packets whose payload is all Fs is greater than 25% of the total number of sent packets in five periods.
Fault diagnosis
After receiving the triggered message in the fault detection state, the ping service node enters the fault diagnosis state.
1:If a packet loss error is detected on the device, the SAID ping node checks whether a module (subcard, TM, or NP) on the device is faulty. If no module is faulty, the system completes the diagnosis and returns to the fault detection state.
2:If a packet loss error is detected on the device, the SAID ping node checks whether a module (subcard, TM, or NP) on the device is faulty. If a module fault occurs, the system performs loopback diagnosis. If packet loss or modification is detected during loopback, the local device is faulty. The system then enters the fault recovery state. If no packet is lost during loopback diagnosis, the system returns to the fault detection state.
Fault recovery
If a fault is detected during loopback diagnosis, the ping service node determines whether a counting error occurs on the associated subcard.
1:If a counting error occurs on the subcard, the ping service node resets the subcard for service recovery. Then, the node enters the service recovery determination state and performs link-heartbeat loopback detection to determine whether services recover. If services recover, the node returns to the fault detection state. If services do not recover, the node returns to the fault recovery state and takes a secondary recovery action. (For a subcard reset, the secondary recovery action is board reset.)
2:If no counting error occurs on the subcard, the ping service node resets the involved board for service recovery. After the board starts, the node enters the service recovery determination state and performs link-heartbeat loopback detection to determine whether services recover. If services recover, the node returns to the fault detection state. If services do not recover, the node remains in the service recovery determination state and periodically performs link-heartbeat loopback detection until services recover.
Service recovery determination
After fault recovery is complete, the ping service node uses the fault packet template to send diagnostic packets. If a fault still exists and a subcard reset is performed, the node generates an alarm and instructs the subcard to perform a switching for self-healing. If a fault still exists but no subcard reset is performed, the node generates an alarm only. If no fault exists, the node instructs the link-heartbeat loopback function to return to the initiate state, and the node itself returns to the fault detection state.
Fault alarm
If link-heartbeat loopback detects packet loss, it triggers SAID ping diagnosis and performs recovery operations (reset the subcard or board). However, services fail to be recovered, and the device detects packet loss and reports an alarm.
;
1. Run the display link-heartbeat command to check link-heartbeat packet loss information on the corresponding interface. Check whether packet loss is detected within five consecutive detection periods (150s).
�If no packet loss is detected within five consecutive detection periods (150s), the alarm is cleared. Go to step 3.
�If packet loss is detected within five consecutive detection periods (150s), the alarm persists. Go to step 2.
2. Collect alarm, log, and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.

(The alarm reporting condition is controlled by the arp host ip-conflict-check command. By default, an alarm is reported when the number of migrations within 180s reaches 5.)
;
1. Based on the alarm information, determine the IP address, BD, and access interface of the alarm user.
�If the alarm user's information can be determined, go to Step 2.
�If the alarm user's information cannot be determined, go to Step 5.
2. Based on the network plan, service deployment, and alarm user information, check the user access information on the BD gateway and the user configuration on the device connected to the user access interface.
�If multiple devices connected to the BD gateway are configured with the same alarm user IP address, go to Step 3.
�Run the debugging arp packet command in the user view to obtain ARP packets of the alarm user, and run the display arp history command in the diagnostic view to check the user change information. If the user frequently goes online between distributed gateways or between different EVC sub-interfaces on the same device, go to Step 4.
�If the same alarm user IP address is not configured on the devices connected to the distributed gateway and packets of the alarm user for frequent access cannot be obtained, go to Step 5.
3. Change the conflicting IP address and check whether the alarm persists.
�If yes, go to Step 2.
�If no, go to Step 6.
4. Based on the user operation logs, check whether the frequent migrations of the alarm user are proper.
�If the frequent migrations of the alarm user can be determined to be proper, go to Step 6.
�If the frequent migrations of the alarm user cannot be determined to be proper, go to Step 5.
5. Collect alarm and configuration information, and contact technical support personnel.

Cause 23: NTP test failures
Cause 24: Synchronization loop is detected
Cause 25: System peer stratum is better
Cause 26: Synchronization distance greater than distance threshold
;
Cause 1: VPN change detected
Select another VPN.
Cause 2: Peer reachability lost
1. Check whether the link to the remote clock source is reachable.
2. If the link is unreachable, rectify the network fault or configure a new remote clock source.
3. If the link is reachable, check whether the source interface is correctly configured.
Cause 3: Authentication failure
Authentication failure packets are discarded and cannot be synchronized.
1. Check whether the key is configured. If no, configure the key. If yes, check whether the key is correct.
2. Check whether the key is set to reliable.
3. Check whether the clock source configuration carries a key.
Cause 4: Authentication configuration changed
If the authentication configuration is changed, rectify the fault according to Cause 3.
Cause 5: KOD DENY received
The client receives a KOD packet with the DENY code, and the remote clock source restricts the synchronization time of the client. Reconfigure a new remote clock source.
Cause 6: Manycast discovery restarted
The manycast client restarts the discovery process. No action is required.
Cause 7: Unicast server configuration removed
The unicast server configuration has been deleted. Reconfigure the NTP unicast server.
Cause 8: Unicast peer configuration removed
The unicast peer configuration is deleted. Reconfigure the NTP unicast peer.
Cause 9: Reference clock configuration removed
The configuration of the master clock is deleted. Reconfigure the NTP local clock as the NTP master clock.
Cause 10: Stratum increase detected
1. The stratum of the remote clock source increases. Check whether the current clock is in the synchronization state.
2. If the clock source is in the synchronous state, check whether the precision meets the requirement. If the precision does not meet the requirement, reconfigure a remote clock source with higher precision.
3. If the remote clock source is not synchronized, reconfigure a new remote clock source.
Cause 11: Peer clock unsynchronized/unselectable
1. The stratum of the remote clock source increases. Check whether the current clock is in the synchronization state.

The manycast client configuration is deleted. Reconfigure the NTP manycast client.
Cause 13: Configuration changed
Check whether the client configuration is deleted. If yes, add the NTP client configuration again.
Cause 14: Clock selection failed - Excessive falsetickers
Clock selection fails due to excessive fake clocks. Delete invalid clock sources and reconfigure valid clock sources.
Cause 15: Clock selection failed - No selectable clock
Clock selection fails because no clock source is available. Configure a valid clock source.
Cause 16: Clock change detected
The time of the clock source changes abruptly. Check the time of the clock source or reconfigure a new remote clock source.
Cause 17: NTP IPv4 Service is disabled
The NTP IPv4 service is disabled. Enable the NTP IPv4 service again.
Cause 18: NTP IPv6 Service is disabled
The NTP IPv6 service is disabled. Enable the NTP IPv6 service again.
Cause 19: Peer is restricted to select
The peer cannot be selected. Reconfigure the NTP peer.
Cause 20: Staled manycast session
The dynamic multicast session is outdated, and no action is required.
Cause 21: Peer is preempted
The peer is preempted, and no action is required.
Cause 22: Invalid stratum/Server not synchronized
1. The stratum of the remote clock source is invalid or not synchronized. Check whether the current clock is in the synchronized state.
2. If the clock source is in the synchronous state, check whether the precision meets the requirement. If the precision does not meet the requirement, reconfigure a remote clock source with higher precision.
3. If the remote clock source is not synchronized, reconfigure a new remote clock source.
Cause 23: NTP test failures
Failed to verify the NTP standard. Configure a new remote clock source.
Cause 24: Synchronization loop is detected
An NTP synchronization loop is detected. Check the NTP configuration on the network.
Cause 25: System peer stratum is better
The system has a better number of peer layers, and no action is required.

Configuration Precautions for STP;RSTP;MSTP;;;;;
(Optional) Configuring DHCPv6 Relay Dual-Device Hot Standby in a VRRP;VRRP6 Master;Backup Backup Scenario;;;;;
1.Configure basic VRRP6 group functions.
1.Run system-view
The system view is displayed.
2.Run interfaceinterface-typeinterface-number [ .subinterface-number ]
The view of the interface where a VRRP6 group needs to be configured is displayed.
3.Run ipv6 enable
IPv6 is enabled for the interface.
4.Run ipv6 address { ipv6-address prefix-length | ipv6-address-mask }
An IPv6 address is configured for the interface.
5.Run vrrp6 vridvirtual-router-idvirtual-ipvirtual-addresslink-local
A VRRP6 group is created and assigned the first virtual IPv6 address.
When a VRRP6 group is created on an interface, the first virtual IPv6 address assigned to the VRRP6 group must be a link-local address.
When the first virtual IPv6 address is assigned to a VRRP6 group, the system creates the VRRP6 group. If another virtual IPv6 address is assigned to the VRRP6 group, the system adds the address to the virtual IPv6 address list.
6.Run vrrp6 vridvirtual-router-idvirtual-ipvirtual-address
A virtual IPv6 address is configured for the VRRP6 group.
Multiple virtual IPv6 addresses can be assigned to a VRRP6 group. A single virtual IPv6 address serves a separate user group, in which users have the same reliability requirements. This setting helps prevent the default gateway addresses from varying according to changes in VRRP6 device locations.
7.Run vrrp6 vridvirtual-router-idpreempt-modetimerdelaydelay-time
A preemption delay is set for the device in the VRRP6 group.
You are advised to set the preemption delay to 0 on a backup device to allow it to preempt the master role immediately after the master device fails or set the preemption delay to a non-0 value on the master device so that it can preempt the master role after a specified delay if a master/backup VRRP6 switchover is performed.
�The interface on which a VRRP6 group is created and the interface on which DHCPv6 relay is configured must belong to the same main interface. Otherwise, VRRP6 cannot detect link faults on the DHCPv6 relay interface.
�In DHCPv6 relay dual-device hot standby scenarios, to ensure that the master device can completely back up user session information to the backup device, you are advised to set a preemption delay greater than or equal to 1800s for the master device.
8.Run vrrp6 vridvirtual-router-idprioritypriority-value
A priority is configured for the device in the VRRP6 group.
Before running this command to perform a master/backup VRRP6 switchover, ensure that the routing entries on the master and backup devices are the same. If they are different, user packet loss may occur.
9.(Optional) Run vrrp6 vridvirtual-router-idtimeradvertiseadvertise-interval
An interval for sending VRRP6 Advertisement packets is set.
The interval at which a device sends VRRP6 Advertisement packets cannot be less than the time that the device takes to perform a master/slave main control board switchover. If the interval is less than the switchover time, protocol flapping may occur during a master/slave main control board switchover. It is recommended that the interval be set to a value greater than 1s.
